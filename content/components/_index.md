# Design Components

Welcome to the Design Components section. This area showcases the various design components and section shortcodes available for use in the Cod3rs Community website.

## Available Example Pages

We've organized our components into example pages that demonstrate how to use them:

1. [**Components Example Page**](/components/example/) - Shows how to use design components like hero banners, cards, and feature boxes in a real-world scenario. Includes code examples for each component.

2. [**Section Components Example**](/components/example-sections/) - Demonstrates how to use section shortcodes to create different layouts and sections. Includes code examples for each section type.

3. [**Full Width Example**](/components/full-width-example/) - Shows how to create pages that span the full width of the browser window.

## When to Use Each Component

Here's a guide to help you decide which component to use in different situations:

- **Hero Banner (Dark)**: Use for main page headers, introductions, or important announcements that need to span the full width of the page.
- **Feature Box (Dark)**: Ideal for highlighting individual features, services, or benefits in a compact format.
- **Card (Dark)**: Perfect for displaying content that needs a clear boundary and possibly a call-to-action button.
- **Split Content (Dark)**: Use when you need to display content alongside an image or code snippet in a two-column layout.
- **Call to Action (Dark)**: Ideal for prompting user engagement with a clear action button, such as sign-ups or registrations.
- **Info Box (White)**: Use for explanatory content, details, or information that needs to stand out against the dark theme.
- **Timeline (White)**: Perfect for displaying chronological events, schedules, or historical information.
- **Highlight Box (Purple)**: Use sparingly for content that needs maximum attention, such as special offers or critical announcements.

Choose components based on your content's purpose and importance. Visit the example pages to see how these components work in practice and to get the code for implementing them.
