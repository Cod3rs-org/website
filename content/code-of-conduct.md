## Code of Conduct

***TL;DR.** Be respectful. Harassment and abuse are never tolerated. If you are in a situation that makes you uncomfortable at a Cod3rs event or workplace, if the event itself is creating an unsafe or inappropriate environment, or if interacting with a Cod3rs representative, event organiser or attendee makes you uncomfortable, please speak up.*

Cod3rs stands for **inclusivity** and **respect**. Every single person has the right to engage in a safe and welcoming environment, be it at the workplace, an event, or at social gatherings.

### Subjects

All members of the Cod3rs organisation, volunteers, and people associated in other ways with any of the organisation's projects, contractors, and anyone else participating in or attending any of the organisation's events, are subjects to this policy.

The code of conduct applies at or in relation to any Cod3rs event or project, during in-person or online interactions related to a Cod3rs event or project, or at social gatherings associated with Cod3rs. By attending or participating in our events or activities, you become subject to any potential further (internal or legal) action in the case of non-compliance with the policy.

### Protected characteristics

Cod3rs prohibits discrimination or harassment based on age, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, race, colour, creed, religion, belief, social class, economic status, nationality, minority affiliation, ancestry, pregnancy or maternity, marital or familial status, citizenship, predisposing genetic characteristics, or any other characteristics protected by law.

### Harassment

**Harassment** is any unwelcome conduct that makes a reasonable person feel uncomfortable, humiliated, intimidated, abused, or mentally distressed or creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive environment. Cases of harassment include but are not limited to physical, visual or verbal (or even suggested) comments, sharing sexual images, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, brigading, doxing, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, derogatory statements, and inappropriate physical contact.

Whether conduct is offensive, unreasonable, or unwanted depends on the recipient’s perception, especially when individuals have different standards of what is considered offensive. If what you’re doing is making someone feel uncomfortable, that counts as harassment and is enough reason to stop doing it.

**Sexual harassment** is a particular type of harassment that includes unwelcome conduct such as sexual advances, flirtations, requests for sexual favours, remarks about an individual’s appearance, discussions, remarks or jokes of a sexual nature, touching an individual’s body, staring in a sexual manner, sex stereotyping, wearing sexualised clothing, asking for dates after the individual indicated that they are not interested, unwelcome sexual attention, and other verbal, visual, or physical conducts that create a sexualised environment.

Sexual harassment can be directed towards persons of the opposite or same gender. Retaliation against an individual for complaining about or reporting the type of behaviour described above is also considered a form of harassment.

### Consequences

Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately. Consequences may lead to a formal warning by Cod3rs, suspension or expulsion from Cod3rs events or projects with no eligibility for reimbursement or refund of any type, and reaching out to respective authorities.

### Amendments

Cod3rs reserves the right to revise, make exceptions to, or otherwise amend these policies in whole or in part.
