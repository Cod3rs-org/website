## Summ3r Cod3 2025 - Let's Build Cool Stuff!

Hey everyone! We're super excited to announce Summ3r Cod3 2025! This is basically your chance to build something awesome over the summer and win some Cod3rs swag while you're at it.

### What's this all about?

Pretty simple really - Summ3r Cod3 runs through July and August where you can build ANY project you want. Seriously, anything! Got an app idea? A game concept? Want to play with AI? Or maybe build something with Arduino? Go for it!

### How do I join in?

It's super easy (promise!):

1. **Pick something fun to build** - whatever interests you!
2. **Code away** - spend your summer evenings and weekends on it
3. **Share what you're doing** - show us your progress, even the messy parts
4. **Finish by Aug 30th** - or at least get it to a showable state ðŸ˜‰

### Want a free shirt or hoodie?

We've got some cool Cod3rs merch for participants, but there are a few requirements (sorry, we had to make some rules):

1. **We need to know you're real** - Your GitHub account should exist before July 1st, 2025, OR just have some social media linked to your LinkedIn (we've had some... interesting submissions in the past ðŸ˜…)

2. **You need to be in Slovakia or Denmark** - That's where we can ship stuff! We're not Amazon Prime (yet).

3. **Show us you actually coded during summer** - You can start now if you want, but we need to see you were active during July-August. No digging up old projects and claiming you just made them!

### No idea what to build?

Don't worry, we've all been there! Here are some random ideas:

- That app you keep complaining doesn't exist
- Something to help with your hobby
- A game your friends might actually play
- A tool that makes your coding life less painful
- Something weird with AI (everyone's doing it, right?)
- That Arduino project collecting dust in your drawer
- Literally anything that sounds fun to you!

### Show us your journey!

We actually care about how you build stuff, not just the final result. So maybe:

- Commit often to GitHub (even the "oops, fixed typo" commits)
- Take screenshots of your progress (the ugly early versions too!)
- Blog about the parts where you got stuck
- Do a quick video at the end showing it working (or almost working)

### Important dates (put them in your calendar or you'll forget)

- **July 1, 2025**: Kickoff day! Start building!
- **All summer**: Keep coding whenever you can
- **August 30, 2025**: Last day to submit! (And yes, we know it's a Saturday)
- **Early September**: We'll show off everyone's projects and send out prizes

### How to submit your project

We're still figuring out the exact details (hey, 2025 is still far away!), but you'll probably need:

- Your repo link
- A quick explanation of what you made and why
- Some screenshots that actually show it working
- A bit about what you learned or what went wrong

### We're here to help!

You're not alone in this! Throughout the summer you can:

- Ask questions in our Discord (we promise to answer... eventually)
- Join our casual check-ins to show what you're working on
- Get help from other participants when you're stuck
- Maybe find a mentor if you need more guidance

### Questions people might ask

**Q: Can my friends and I work together?**  
A: Totally! Just make sure everyone who wants a shirt meets the requirements.

**Q: I already started something, can I use that?**  
A: Sure, but you need to actually work on it during the summer. We can tell the difference!

**Q: Do I need to be some coding genius?**  
A: Definitely not! We've seen amazing projects from beginners. Just build something YOU think is cool.

**Q: What programming language should I use?**  
A: Whatever you want! Seriously, use what you know or what you want to learn.
