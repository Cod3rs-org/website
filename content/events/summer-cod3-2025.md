Hey everyone! We're super excited to announce Summ3r Cod3 2025! This is basically your chance to build something awesome over the summer and win some Cod3rs swag while you're at it.

### What's this all about?

Pretty simple really - Summ3r Cod3 runs through July and August where you can build ANY project you want. Seriously, anything! Got an app idea? A game concept? Want to play with AI? Or maybe build something with Arduino? Go for it!

### How do I join in?

It's super easy (promise!):

1. **Pick something fun to build** - whatever interests you!
2. **Code away** - spend your summer evenings and weekends on it
3. **Share what you're doing** - show us your progress, even the messy parts
4. **Finish by Aug 30th** - or at least get it to a showable state ðŸ˜‰

### Win a Cod3rs shirt or hoodie!

We've got some cool Cod3rs merch exclusively for the winners of the public opinion vote. To qualify for the prizes, you'll need to meet these requirements:

1. **We need to know you're real** - Your GitHub account should exist before July 1st, 2025, OR just have some social media linked to your LinkedIn (we've had some... interesting submissions in the past ðŸ˜…)

2. **You need to be in Slovakia or Denmark** - That's where we can ship prizes! We're not Amazon Prime (yet).

3. **Show us you actually coded during summer** - You can start now if you want, but we need to see you were active during July-August. No digging up old projects and claiming you just made them!

4. **Win the public vote** - Only projects that receive the most votes in the public opinion voting will win merchandise.

### No idea what to build?

Don't worry, we've all been there! Here are some random ideas:

- That app you keep complaining doesn't exist
- Something to help with your hobby
- A game your friends might actually play
- A tool that makes your coding life less painful

### More ideas:

- Something weird with AI (everyone's doing it, right?)
- That Arduino project collecting dust in your drawer
- Literally anything that sounds fun to you!
- A website for your favorite hobby
- A mobile app that solves a daily problem

### Show us your journey!

We actually care about how you build stuff, not just the final result. So maybe:

- Commit often to GitHub (even the "oops, fixed typo" commits)
- Take screenshots of your progress (the ugly early versions too!)
- Blog about the parts where you got stuck
- Do a quick video at the end showing it working (or almost working)

### How to submit your project

We're still figuring out the exact details (hey, 2025 is still far away!), but you'll probably need:

- Your repo link
- A quick explanation of what you made and why
- Some screenshots that actually show it working
- A bit about what you learned or what went wrong

### We're here to help!

You're not alone in this! Throughout the summer you can:

- Ask questions in our Discord (we promise to answer... eventually)
- Join our casual check-ins to show what you're working on
- Get help from other participants when you're stuck
- Maybe find a mentor if you need more guidance

### Questions people might ask

**Q: Can my friends and I work together?**  
A: Totally! Just make sure everyone who wants a shirt meets the requirements.

**Q: I already started something, can I use that?**  
A: Sure, but you need to actually work on it during the summer. We can tell the difference!

### More questions

**Q: Do I need to be some coding genius?**  
A: Definitely not! We've seen amazing projects from beginners. Just build something YOU think is cool.

**Q: What programming language should I use?**  
A: Whatever you want! Seriously, use what you know or what you want to learn.
